    This Add-on allows you to select multiple documents, uses x-ray library to identify bad redactions,
    creates annotations where bad redactions exist, and exports document_ids, page numbers, bounding boxes and the text in a csv file.
    By checking the box, this will redact bad redactions and delete any existing bad redaction annotations.


    **Warning**: Once you check this box and run this Add-On, you cannot undo redactions.
